//Shatter Stone: Starter Pack// 2023 //

- Package setup for built-in render pipeline by default. 

- If using URP or HDRP make sure to swap the shader on materials to a corrosponding one for the RP, or use unity's built in material updater.

- Shatter and spawn controlled by script graphs, only object variables are used. 

- If scripts are not showing on the prefabs then check the Visual Scripting package is installed. 

- In demo level simply play scene and click on the ore node to trigger the shatter fx and resource spawn.

Paid packs in the Shatter Stone series include:
- More nodes and resources.
- Customizeable colours to create variations.
- Rock tinting to blend nodes into an environment. 
- Sprites for each resource to use in your UI.
